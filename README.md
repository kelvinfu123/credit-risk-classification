## Overview of the Analysis

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  As the precision of the healthy loan class is 1.00 ,indicating that the model predicts this label with perfect precision. Meanwhile the precision of "high risk loan class " is 0.87 meaning that 87% of the predicted high risk are correct . In other words , means the "health loan " model captures all the healthy loans , while the "high risk loan identifies 89% of the high-risk loans correctly.

 If we check the F1 score , the "healthy loan" class, the F1-score is 1.00, indicating perfect performance. The F1-score for the "high-risk loan" class is 0.88, meaning theres a good balance between precision and recall for this label.

 the accuracy score is 99% referring the model is performing well



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  As the precision of the healthy loan class is 1.00 ,indicating that the model predicts this label with perfect precision. Meanwhile the precision of "high risk loan class " is 0.87 meaning that 87% of the predicted high risk are correct . In other words , means the "health loan " model captures all the healthy loans , while the "high risk loan identifies 89% of the high-risk loans correctly.

 If we check the F1 score , the "healthy loan" class, the F1-score is 1.00, indicating perfect performance. The F1-score for the "high-risk loan" class is 0.93, meaning theres a good balance between precision and recall for this label.

 the accuracy score is 100% referring the model is performing well  


 This model was able to reduce the value of False Negative all the way from 67 down to 2 , as minimising false negatives we can able to  optimise resource allocation, focusing efforts on instances that truly require attention. Thus enhancing the reliability and credibility of the predictions and also the trust from users.

## Summary

The reduction of false negatives is extremely crucial as migating potential risks and identify high-risk loans
